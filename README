"""
The "Seismic wave simulation using DAS" GitHub repository is a project aimed at simulating the propagation
of seismic waves through different geological scenarios using DAS (Distributed Acoustic Sensing) technology. 
The project focuses mainly on the application of simulation to capture and storage of CO2, 
but it can also be used for other purposes.

The repository contains code in Python and Java that implements the finite element solution 
to simulate the propagation of seismic waves. Specialized libraries for finite element solution and result visualization, 
such as NumPy, SciPy, Matplotlib, JMathPlot, and JFreeChart, are also provided. In addition, notebooks and scripts are included 
that show how to use the simulation in different geological scenarios.

The project is useful for researchers and professionals working on the capture and storage of CO2, 
as it allows simulating the behavior of seismic waves in different geological formations and predicting 
potential issues during operation. The repository can also be useful for those interested in seismic wave simulation in general, 
as it provides a framework for implementing the finite element solution in Python and Java.
